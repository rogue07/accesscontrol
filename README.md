This projects goal is to be able to use NFC fobs or cards to trigger a relay and open
a lock.

I'm using the Raspberry pi4 as well as Adafruit's RFID/NFC reader.

The program itself will accept users and associate a card with them, it then saves
the data to MariaDB database. I added a menu option to test the relay and lock as
well.
